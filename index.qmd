I am a sixth year PhD candidate in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource
Management program at the University of Washington. My research focuses on
applying spatiotemporal statistical models to questions in fisheries management
and ecology. In particular, I am developing models for indices of abundance that
include fishery-dependent observations. I am also interested in improving the
computational efficiency and reliability of Bayesian model fits through the
application of advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo tools like the No-U-Turn
Sampler. Prior to graduate school I worked in aviation maintenance and the
outdoor industry.

When I'm not working I spend time with my family, play with my dog, run, and
learn about whatever new and exciting hobby I've more recently found.
